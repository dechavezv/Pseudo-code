# Import my file with all my DNA sequences from my Dropbox directory
 
# Take only those sequences that are from inter-Anden valleys and save them in a different file called mice_from_valleys

# Take only those sequences that are from highlands and save them in a different file called mice_from_paramos

# To make the codon partitions make a function that catches base pares from the first position of every codon and save it into a different file, do the same thing for the second third position of every codon.

# Calculate the evolutionary models fro the different partitions

#Concatane all the DNA sequence into a single fast file 

# Make the phylogenetic reconstruction trough Python 

# Add the DNA sequence to an excel with the geographic coordinates 

#trough the program Gengis, make a plot of the phylogeny with the geographic distribution
